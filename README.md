## 🦙 Tina CMS

By default, this template comes pre-configured with Tina CMS.

Now you can create your posts directly from the CMS without the need to do it manually.

If you decide to use Tina, it's not necessary to add any properties to the Markdown files, Tina does it automatically.

Example:

https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template/assets/44746462/51ae324c-d383-40be-9b16-db159d1af15d

The documentation for Tina CMS can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/)

> Tina is completely optional, and you can remove it, and it will still function in the same way.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

**Recommended extensions for VSCode:**

- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
- [Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

1. Clone or [fork](https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template/fork) the repository:

```bash
git@github.com:danielcgilibert/blog-template.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 📐 Configure

- Edit the configuration file **src/data/site.config.ts** for the basic blog metadata.
- Modify the files in the **/public** folder:
  - favicon
  - robots.txt -> update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - open-graph -> the open-graph is the image that will be displayed when sharing the blog link. For posts, the preview image is the post cover.
- Edit the social networks in **src/data/links.ts**, change the URL to your social network.

## 🗂️ Adding a category

To add a new category to your blog, simply go to the src/data/categories.ts file and add it to the array.

Example:

```ts
export  const  CATEGORIES  =  [
'JavaScript',
'React',
'new category here'  <---
]  as  const
```

> 🚨 Zod checks whether the category is not correctly written or does not exist in the properties of the markdown document. **It will throw an error when building the application.** 🚨

## 📄 Adding a post

Adding a post is as simple as adding a .md or .mdx file to the blog folder at the path **src/content/blog**. The filename will be used to create the slug/URL of the page.

For example, if you have a file named **jsx-and-react.md**, it will be transformed into: **http://yourdomain.com/post/jsx-and-react/**

## 📝 Activating draft mode

To activate draft mode, add the property **draft: true** to the file, and it will no longer be displayed on the blog.

Example :

```ts
title: MacBook Pro 2022
description: 'The new MacBook Pro 2022 is here. With the Apple M2 chip, a new design, and more, the new MacBook Pro is the best laptop Apple has ever made.'
pubDate: 'Jul 02 2022'
heroImage: '../../assets/bg.jpg'
category: 'Category 1'
tags: ['JavaScript', 'css', 'HTML5', 'GitHub']
draft: true <---
```

## ⚡️ Frontmatter

## Required properties:

- Title
- Description
- pubDate
- heroImage (post cover)
- category (Choose a category from src/data/categories.ts)

## Optional properties:

- draft (no need to include it, by default it's false)
- tags

> The schema for posts is located at src/content/config.ts. You can modify any parameter, for example, by adding a maximum of 80 characters for titles: title: z.string().max(80).
> For more information, refer to the zod documentation.

## Deploy on Wasmer

[![Deploy to Wasmer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy%20to-Wasmer-171717?logo=wasmer&logoColor=white)](https://wasmer.io/apps/create?github=danielcgilibert%2Fblog-template)

[Wasmer Edge](https://docs.wasmer.io/edge/) is a cloud platform for hosting websites and applications. The button imports the public demo; for your own posts and future updates, fork this repository, customize its content and site settings, and import your fork instead.

The [Anybuild configuration](Anybuild) uses Node.js 24 and pnpm 8.15.9 to build and serve the static `dist` directory, including the Pagefind search index. To reproduce the build locally:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
pnpm rebuild esbuild sharp
pnpm run build
```

The install skips lifecycle scripts for TinaCMS's older native database dependency, then rebuilds the packages used by the static site. This deployment serves the published blog only; TinaCMS editing requires a separate setup.
